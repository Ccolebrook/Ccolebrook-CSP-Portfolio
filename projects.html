 <p>Our game is a choice based adventure game that was made on Scratch using its language. The purpose of our game is to explore as you try to get of an island. As you are exploring you are faced with a series of choices that have “good” and “bad” options. The choices you make affect your “karma” which is a variable that keep track of positive and negative choices. Your overall karma at the end of the game decides the games ending. In this video we see the title screen, character selection, introduction, and some of the choices that can be made.

  <p>We designed our app using MIT app inventor which uses a block based programming language. Our app was designed to serve as a tool to help track and log your excretory system. The main purpose of our app was to identify and log ones excrement in order to show your doctor when needed. Our app records the amount of time spent on the toilet and the type excrement. This app will provide information about a person’s bowel movement to a doctor that the doctor previously couldn't have accurate information about before. The doctor can use this information in different diagnoses and diet recommendations. Our video starts with the timer being started. Then we see the time being saved and the 7 different types of excrement of the bristol stool sample appear. After the stool type is selected the screen, gets changed to the home screen and then the log screen. The update button is pushed and the stool type and time is added to the log.
